You are a senior full-stack engineer.
Your task is to fix logic, flows, and trust issues in the existing AutomateHub project.
❗ DO NOT redesign the UI or change styles unless required to fix bugs.
❗ DO NOT add fake data, stats, reviews, or new pages unless explicitly asked.

1. CHECKOUT FLOW (CRITICAL)
Current problem

Checkout forces login before payment (WRONG).

Required behavior

Allow guest checkout.

User can:

Add to cart

Proceed to checkout

Pay via Razorpay without logging in

AFTER successful payment:

If user is logged out → show “Login / Create account to access downloads”

After login → unlock downloads + orders + dashboard

Do NOT block payment behind authentication.

2. POST-PAYMENT DELIVERY (CRITICAL)

Create a real success & download flow.

After verified Razorpay payment:

Redirect to /checkout/success

Show:

✅ Payment successful

Product(s) purchased

Download section per product

Button: “Download JSON”

Link goes to a public Google Drive file URL (placeholder stored per product)

Tutorial video

Embed same YouTube video for all products

Position: floating side widget

Behavior:

Autoplay

Muted

Explains how to import .json into n8n

Make video ID configurable in code.

3. REMOVE ALL FAKE SOCIAL PROOF (CRITICAL)

❌ REMOVE everywhere:

Star ratings (e.g., 4.9 ⭐)

Reviews count

Downloads count

“Loved by thousands” type claims

If data is not real, it must not exist.

4. WISHLIST (FIX LOGIC)
Current problem

Wishlist works without login (local-only).

Required behavior

Wishlist is user-based, requires login.

If logged out:

Clicking ❤️ → redirect to login

After login → return to previous page

Wishlist page shows only user’s saved templates.

No guest wishlist.

5. SEARCH (KEEP, FIX IF NEEDED)

Search must:

Filter templates by title, tags, short description

Must NOT:

Break routing

Return blank pages

Keep it simple and reliable.

6. DASHBOARD / ORDERS / SETTINGS (MINIMAL, FUNCTIONAL)

All require login.

/dashboard

Show:

User email

Purchased templates

Quick links to Orders, Wishlist, Settings

/orders

List:

Order ID

Date

Amount (₹ placeholder)

Purchased templates

“Go to download” button

/settings

Change password

Logout

Minimal UI is fine. Functionality matters.

7. AUTHENTICATION RULES

Email + password only

Password:

Min 8 characters

Forgot password:

Email OTP only

After login:

Redirect to last visited page

8. RAZORPAY (LIVE-READY)
Required

Razorpay live mode

Backend:

Create order

Verify signature

Webhook:

Verify webhook signature

Handle payment success idempotently

Use env vars:

RAZORPAY_KEY_ID

RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET

RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET

9. PRICING & CURRENCY RULES

Use Indian Rupees only

Format exactly:

₹199/-

Whole numbers only

Do NOT change existing card layouts

Just ensure prices display correctly and consistently

10. HERO & COPY (SMALL FIX ONLY)

Improve clarity without redesign.

Replace vague hero text with something explicit, for example:

Ready-to-Use n8n Automation Templates
Deploy proven workflows in minutes using JSON imports.

No buzzwords. No fake claims.

11. BACKGROUND PARTICLES (PERFORMANCE FIX)

Keep particle background

Reduce particle count on mobile

Lower opacity

Must not affect scroll or interaction performance

12. LEGAL PAGES (KEEP AS IS)

Privacy Policy

Terms of Service

Refund Policy (14 days)

Ensure:

Footer links work on all pages

No broken routing

13. CLEANUP & QUALITY

No 404 routes

No dead links

No console errors

No unused components

No hallucinated features

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

After completing changes:

Provide a short summary of what was fixed

List remaining limitations (e.g., Google Drive link security)

Confirm app runs without errors

🚫 ABSOLUTE RULE

If something is not explicitly requested above, DO NOT add it.
