You are a senior full-stack engineer. Audit and fix my existing project end-to-end. Do NOT redesign the UI unless necessary to fix broken layouts. Priority is: make all routes/pages/features work, remove fake content, and implement a real purchase → unlock download flow. Keep existing components/styles wherever possible.

0) Hard requirements (must follow)
Currency is Indian Rupees and all prices are displayed as placeholders like: ₹199/- (whole numbers only, no decimals).

Remove fake testimonials/reviews sections entirely.

Newsletter feature must be removed entirely (UI + routes + footer links).

Implement real Wishlist (saved per logged-in user).

Implement real Search (filter templates list).

Add minimal functional: Orders page, User dashboard, Account settings (must require login).

Auth: Email + Password, Forgot password via Email OTP. Password min 8 chars.

After login, redirect user to last visited page (or a safe fallback if none).

Payments: Razorpay live mode, backend signature verification, webhook support.

Product delivery: after successful payment, show Download page with:

a button linking to a public-with-link Google Drive file URL (placeholder link for now, stored per product).

a YouTube video embedded as a floating side widget, autoplay muted, instructions on importing JSON to n8n (same video for all templates).

1) Fix routing and broken pages (current issues)
Currently many pages return 404 or blank states (Templates/About/Contact/Wishlist/Search/etc). Fix all broken routes, ensure navbar/footer links never 404. Every link should either:

work fully, OR

be explicitly removed (NOT left broken).

Required routes:

/ (Home)

/templates (Templates listing)

/templates/:id (Template detail)

/cart

/checkout

/checkout/success

/login

/signup

/forgot-password

/dashboard (requires login)

/orders (requires login)

/settings (requires login)

/wishlist (requires login)

/privacy-policy

/terms

/refund-policy

If About/Contact exist in UI, either implement minimal pages or remove all references. No dead links.

2) Data model (use placeholders now, real products later)
Create a simple product dataset in code for now (can be a JSON array or seed in DB). Each template should have:

id, title, shortDescription, longDescription

placeholderPrice (number)

driveDownloadUrl (string, placeholder)

tags/categories (array)

thumbnail image (existing placeholder ok)

Listing page shows cards with:

existing design unchanged as much as possible

title, shortDescription, placeholder price shown as “₹{price}/-”

Add to cart button working

Wishlist toggle button working (requires login, else redirect to login)

Template detail page:

shows template details

price placeholder

add to cart

buy now (go to checkout)

3) Cart + Checkout (fix bugs, make it consistent)
Cart must persist during session (localStorage ok).

Cart shows items, quantities (optional), subtotal (placeholder).

Checkout:

If user not logged in: allow checkout initiation (per requirement “Force login before checkout: NO”).

BUT: download unlock and wishlist/orders/dashboard/settings require login.

Therefore: after payment success, if user is not logged in, force a “Create account / Login to access download” gate.

Implement Razorpay checkout:

Use Razorpay live keys via env vars:

RAZORPAY_KEY_ID

RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET

Backend creates order with Razorpay Orders API.

Frontend opens Razorpay checkout with order_id.

Backend verifies payment signature (razorpay_payment_id, razorpay_order_id, razorpay_signature).

Only after verification, mark purchase as PAID and create an Order record.

Implement webhook endpoint:

Verify webhook signature with webhook secret in env var.

Handle payment.captured or relevant events to reconcile state.

Make webhook idempotent.

4) Orders / Dashboard / Settings (minimal functional, login required)
All require authentication.

Dashboard (/dashboard):

Show: user email, quick links to Orders, Wishlist, Settings

Show a “Purchased templates” list (from orders).

Orders (/orders):

List orders: order id, date, amount (placeholder ₹), status, templates purchased.

Clicking an order opens details + “Go to Download” button for purchased templates.

Settings (/settings):

Change password (requires current password)

Forgot password flow also exists separately.

5) Authentication (email/password + email OTP reset)
Implement:

Signup: email + password (min 8)

Login

Persist session (JWT or secure session cookies; pick a simple secure approach).

Forgot password:

user enters email

system generates OTP, emails OTP (use a placeholder email provider if none is configured; but structure code so it can be swapped later; at least log OTP in dev).

user verifies OTP, sets new password.

Redirect after login to last visited page:

Save intended route before redirecting to login (including from wishlist/dashboard/settings/orders).

After login, return user there.

6) Wishlist (real)
Logged-in users can save templates to wishlist.

Wishlist page lists saved templates with remove button and link to template page.

If logged out and user clicks wishlist toggle, redirect to login and then return.

7) Search (real)
Templates page has search input.

Filters templates list by title/tags/shortDescription (client-side is fine for now).

Must not break routing (no blank pages).

Optional: add category/tag chips if already present, otherwise skip.

8) Download page + YouTube floating widget
After verified payment and user authenticated:

Provide a download section per purchased template:

“Download JSON” button → opens that template’s public Google Drive link.

Show warning: “Link is hosted on Google Drive.”

YouTube video widget:

Fixed/floating on side of page (not blocking on mobile).

Autoplay muted.

Same video for all templates.

Provide a config constant for the YouTube video ID.

If user is not logged in after payment:

Show “Login/Create account to access download.”

After login, show the download section.

9) Legal pages (generate content)
Create and add content pages:

Privacy Policy (simple startup-friendly)

Terms of Service (simple startup-friendly)

Refund Policy: refunds allowed within 14 days from purchase, with conditions:

If file is not delivered or broken, refund eligible

If user already accessed/downloaded successfully, refund may be denied (state clearly)

Keep these pages accessible in footer links.

10) Background particle animation (light background, dark particles)
Add a lightweight React particle background:

Dark particles on light background.

Mobile-friendly: reduce particle count on small screens.

Must not harm performance.

Keep rest of design unchanged.

11) Remove/clean up
Remove newsletter UI and any forms/components/routes.

Remove testimonials/reviews sections and fake counts if present (keep any real stats if they exist; otherwise remove).

Fix any 404 routes by implementing or removing links.

Ensure code quality: no console errors, no broken imports, no unused routes.

12) Deliverables
Implement everything above.

Provide a short “What changed” summary and a checklist of what’s now working.

Ensure it runs without errors and all routes are accessible.
